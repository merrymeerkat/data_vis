In Brazil, covid 19 figures have so far been dated not based on when a new case or death occurs, but rather based on when this case is successfully notified to the Ministry of Health. Local health departments must send their data to a nationwide platform by noon at any given day, and the Ministry of Health consolidates this information by 4 pm, after which case-counting is finalised. However, because the computing of figures is not automatic, there are often delays, and the official government-released covid-19 data for any given day is often a poor reflection of how many cases actually happened that day.

Here, I take a look at the mean number of new cases and the mean number of new deaths, as per government data, by weekday. Sundays show an overwhelmingly lower number of cases, which could be a result of a slower pace of work and subsequently slower updating of figures in this day of the week.
