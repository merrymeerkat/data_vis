This is a compilation of visualizations and projections I made about the covid-19 pandemic in Brazil. Each subfolder contains an R Markdown file and the data (in .csv format) used in it, as well as a pdf and png with the visualizations. 

The covid-19 data comes from Brazil's Ministry of Health(https://covid.saude.gov.br/).
